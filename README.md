# PongSpeed
pong game, but the speed increases every few hits

- Use the up and down arrows to move your "paddle" up and down (user paddle is on the right side, computer is on the left)
- Use W and S keys to move up and down at a slower rate
- Ball speed increases every three paddle hits
- Don't let the ball hit your wall!
